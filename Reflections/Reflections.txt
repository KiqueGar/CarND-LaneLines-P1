Reflections on project 1

Might be better to lower mask below horizon line, (see steps_whiteCarLaneSwitch0.jpg)

Things to try out:
	Equalization:
	http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html
Equalization before of after blur?
To mask or to complete image?

After equualization:
	Image sharpens, see above questions as to no overfit
	"Less is more"


Moified mask polygon, from 300->310, Using equalize (steps_whiteCarLaneSwitch1)

Change low_threshold 50->60 high_threshold 150->200 ()

After ffmpg error
From Python console, I have typed following and it worked
import imageio
imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()
